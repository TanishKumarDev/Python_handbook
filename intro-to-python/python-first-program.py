# print hello world
print("Hello, World!")

#  sum of numbers
# In C++: You'd need includes, main(), loops with types.
# In Python: Simple and direct.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)  # Built-in function
print(total)  # Output: 15

# Underanding Working
num = 5 + 30
print(num)
print(type(num))

# Parser sees x = 5 + 3: Creates integers, adds them, assigns to x.
# print(x): Looks up x, converts to string, outputs via OS calls.
